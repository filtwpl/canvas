A lil thing for a Planet Hacks 2020:  
A super simple drawing program (like Procreate or IbisPaintX, but less op).  
Notes: The slider is for pen thickness, the grey button is to clear the canvas, and the rainbow is to randomize your color.
This was my first time making something on Processing that's not a game or a fancy visual effect, so hopefully it's not too bad haha.  
Thanks and stay safe! <3
