A lil thing for a Planet Hacks 2020:  
A super simple drawing program (like Procreate or IbisPaintX, but less op).  
Notes: The slider is for pen thickness, the grey button is to clear the canvas, and the rainbow is to randomize your color.
The demo video is supposed to be Aang, but it's so bad you can't really tell, sorry.   
Thanks and stay safe! <3
